### Sentimental values within communities

If we investigate the average sentimental value within each community, it is assumed on behalf of the hypothesis for this project, that the values will be lower for communities containing more modern artists, and vica verca. The average sentimental value is calculated by taking the total average of all lyrics related sVal values within a community. These calculations are listed to the right.

As we investigate the values, it is clear that the communties housing the top modern artists all have lower sentimental values in comparrison to the rest. The numbers doesn't fluctuate too much, however they all represent sentimental values for mainstream music. If the hyphothesis was false, then it would be very unlikely that the exact communities with lowest overall values, all feature modern the most recent artists.

The biggest community (number **8**) that mostly consisted of rappers has by far the lowest value, ranking in at **5,47**. Community **1**, **11** and **16** follows shortly after with the values **5,57**, **5,58** and **5,62** (rounded). Interestingly, it seems by looking up the top artists within these communities, that rap musician's slowly shrinks. Besides *Justin Bieber*, community **1** almost entirely conists of rappers as well (For the top 10 part nonetheless), whereas community **16** seems to be housing a broad variety of genres, including both rap, pop and edm. Even *Hannah Montana* is part of this community - "Miley Cyrus'" disney child actor character, whom is also represented in real person. The score of this community also gets really close to the rest, which indicates that genre does play some part to the sentimental average - and not just time.

All in all, there does seem to be a clear tendency of more negativity regarding communities of more modern artists, especially the ones who identifies as rappers.
