Now we know that the general use of profanity is increasing, but can we get a sense of what words are primarily used in music, and has there been a shift?

By looking at the most commonly used swear words based on year, we calculate the term frequency and use these values to create the figure below.

What we can observe through the graph is again a general increase in frequency for profanity, but in addition to that we see a shift in which words are used in different periods. We have that profanity such as *hell* and *negro* was the goto in the time from 1968 to 180, and words such as *nigga* and *bitch* is the most frequent now.
