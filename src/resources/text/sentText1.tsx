Interested in how the trend in average sentimental value over time looked, we looked at the average sentimental 
value of songs for every year since 1963. We plotted the data points in a bar graph to visualize the evolution over 
time. This visualization revealed a negative trend in the average sentimental value of lyrics for each year. 
Our graph is shown zoomed in to highlight the trend, and it is only meant to show the fact that such a trend 
exists. It is not necessarily meant to show the magnitude of the change over time.  
The findings of this analysis aligns with our initial hypothesis and marks completion of one of our core goals. 
Music has indeed become more negatively charged over time if we consider the sentimental value of lyrics as an indicator.
