## Popular terms within each network

As with the most popular terms for the whole network, Wordclouds are a good visual tool to get a grasp of what lyrical strengs each community withholds opposed to each other. These wordclouds will like before be created by aggregating all lyrical texts within each community. This time however, the frequency distribution will not only be calculated by raw count, but in relation to common terms in the other communities - so called TF-IDF counts. This means that words that are unique to one community will have a high score, whereas words like "love" presumed to be heavily used within each community will not.

These wordclouds consisting of unique terms might seem rubbish at first. However, by analyzing in relation to found artists within the different communities, they do make some sense!
