## Goals

Our project aims to find whether or not there is a negative trend in current music concerning negativity. We want to find out if the general trend of sentimental values in lyrics have been negative, and whether or not the negativity is contained in smaller communities or not. In short, we want to answer the following questions:

- Is there a general negative trend when it comes to the average sentimental values of lyrics over the years?
- Can we, via communities, find local interconnected groups of artists that line up with our understanding of genres and collaborating artists?
- Is there a contained lower sentimental average within recent communities?
