From just looking at the top artists within each network on both metrics, it is clear that there exist some sort of relation between them.

The biggest community (number 8) naturally houses many of the biggest artist; "Drake", "Future", "Travis Scott" and "Young Thug". These were all part of the top 10 most connected artists. They are also all modern rap/hip hop artist with recent hits, just like the rest.

Many of the artists top in both categories, however some who tend to work more alone, are now present as well - like "The Weeknd" for example.

The second biggest community (number 2) houses totally different artists, all with performance origin around the 90's. If you look up "Fat Joe", "Mary J. Blige", "Sheryl Crow", "Fabolous" and "Fat Joe", they all differ in genres, unlike before. The music industry was different back then though[15],[16].

Community 1, 16 and 11 all features modern artists, with multiple being on the top featuring list above too. More genres seem to emerge at this point, as pop and electronic artists are included as well.

Community 2, 0, 10, 7 and 4 all withholds artists from different eras. "Marvin Gaye", "The Beach Boys", "Bruce Springsteen" and "CÃ©line Dion" from community 0 are all extremely popular artists with performance origin around the 70's and 80's, whereas equally big names like "Stevie Wonder", "The Rolling Stones", "Michael Jackson", "Paul McCartney" etc. top community 4, who mostly began their music career around 10 years earlier according to quick google searches. Most artists are still performing this very day though, so their popularity have crossed each other at some point.

Ultimately, time seems to be the ever ruling influating on what community an artists belong to, though genre does seem to influate slightly as well on the more modern ones.
