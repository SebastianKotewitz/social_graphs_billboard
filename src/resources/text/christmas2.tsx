But if we inspect the top 10 Christmas songs list a bit closer, we notice that not all of the entries are actually Christmas songs (entries 3, 7, 9 and 10). A way to further filter our Christmas songs list is by analyzing if a song actually mentions anything about Christmas. The way we do this creating a Christmas word list with the help of *teachstarterâ€™s* Christmas Vocabulary which can be found on [this link]( https://www.teachstarter.com/au/teaching-resource/christmas-word-wall-vocabulary/). 

By going through the network once more, but this time also checking if a song has any Christmas words, we get the following top 10 Christmas songs, with the average sentimental value being around 5.9.
