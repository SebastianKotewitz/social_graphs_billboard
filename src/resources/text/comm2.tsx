## Largest connected component
To find communities, artists with no or insignificant relation to the largest connected component (biggest spider web of artists stongly connected to each other) within the network have been removed. This is done to elimiate small uninteresting communities and provide the algorithm used to divide the network into different partitionings with the best possible terms of conditions. The illustration of this huge interconnected spiderweb looks like the picture to the right. In opposition to the whole network visualized on the front page, all artists are connected to each other this time around. Just by looking at the visualization, multiple communities seems to appear in the outer rims.
