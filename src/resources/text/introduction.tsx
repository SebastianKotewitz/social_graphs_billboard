Music plays a part in the daily lives of almost everyone and is one of the most widely used media of entertainment. 
On average an individual listens to music up to 18 hours a week which corresponds to 52 minutes daily. 
Music generally gathers inspiration from current trends and topics, which means that it can be quite significant in 
determining a popular trend in a specific period. In this project we look at the most popular songs through history 
(From 1963) and analyze period defining tendencies. What we want to investigate is whether we can observe a generally 
decrease in sentimental value and an increase in the use of strong language as well as determine whether this is a 
general trend or if itâ€™s based on isolated events.
