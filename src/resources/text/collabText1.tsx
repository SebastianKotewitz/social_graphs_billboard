The graph shows the relation between total songs and the amount of songs which have been collaboratory work, where a
value of 0 means no songs for that year are collaborative works, and a value of 1 means every song is a collaboration.  
The results show a considerable trend towards more collaboration. It is also interesting to see how some 
of the earlier years appear to have more collaboration between artists than the years 1970-1989.
