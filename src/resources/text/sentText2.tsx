Out of curiosity, we also made a visualization of the average sentimental value of songs within quarters of the year. 
Every song had its sentimental value attached to the quarter of the year in which it first appeared, and the average 
sentimental value for each of the four yearly quarters was calculated. These averages are presented as a bar graph, 
and it is shown that the average sentimental value of songs per quarter is *very* similar. The graph shows no significant 
relation between quarter and sentimental value. The data is independent of release year.
