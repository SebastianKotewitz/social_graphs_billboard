The first wordcloud for communtiy 8 is filled with different slang. New invented slang is very common among modern rap musicians, which is exactly what this comminy consist of.

The second wordcloud related to community 2 still uses slang, however in a more traditional way. Many words are actual words as well, and seem quite different. It was revealed that this community houses many different music genres, which makes sense in relation to the different use of distinct words.

If we investigate community 4 that withholds some of the biggest artists of all times, with their origin around the 60's, the biggest term "addams" most likely refers to the popular fictional family "The addams family", that ran as television show back in the 60's [17]. "Bowakawa" and "pousse" form a popular song by John Lennon, and "angie" and "shadoobie" are both popular songs by "The Rolling Stones". Let's not forget Michael Jacksons wonder "Smooth Criminal" either.

It is also impossible not to notice the big "Jolene" all over community 7 which must of course refer to Dolly Partons mega hit by the same name. If we investigate which community she belongs to, it is of course this exact one! You can try to play around with these communities yourself and find other cool terms and artists by downlading the network and following the instructions in the linked Ipython Notebook listed at the bottom.
