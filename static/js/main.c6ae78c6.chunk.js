However, as rap is her primary performing form, she and others have been grouped like so.\n\nThe artist gathering "**Artists United Against Apartheid**" is a collection of artist who gathered together as one group to produce a single song called "Sun City". As 58 artists featured on this track, this one-time artist group is, due to the categorization of the data, ranked as one of the highest valued primary artists.\n\nIt is also important to note that "**Earth, Wind**" refers to "**Earth, Wind & Fire**". The band name has been split up into two artists by the implemented algorithm (as & usually refers to different primary artists on Genius). If you were to investigate the network, you would see that "**Fire**" is as expected ranked as number 11 with the exact same number of featured artist connections. This is one example of where the algorithm isn\'t optimal, but it is extremely hard to prepare for every possible real world scenario, and as "&" most often means seperation of main artists on Genius\' api, it was decided not to change the chosen approach.\n\nYou can download the network yourself and play around with it, and see if you can find other cool patterns or implement specific attributes.
